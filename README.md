## Git-Auto Commit

This is an amazing small tool, which automates your usage of GIT. When a file changes, it creates a commit and pushes it to your remote GIT repository.

## Git Auto Initialise Local + Remote Repo

This is another small tool for initialising Local as well as Remote repo.

## Contributions:

If you want to make contribution then you may add a file "Auto_scheduled.sh" commit which will be associated with cronetab in linux to automatically check the changes in a local repo and update it to remote repo.
